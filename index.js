// 1. UNDERSTANDING EVENT PROPAGATION
// Event propagation is a mechanism that defines how events propagate or travel through the DOM tree to arrive at its target and what happens to it afterward.



// 1.1 Event Propagation includes 3 phases i.e
// Event Capturing , Target & Event Bubbling. 

// 1.2 EVENT  CAPTURING

// This capturing phase starts from the root and travels all the way to the target.
// SEE the image to learn more

// 1.3 TARGET 

// This is the phase where the journey all the way to taget is finished .

// 1.4 EVENT BUBBLING

//  In the EVENT BUBBLING PHASE it travels back to the root from the target in DOM. It is basically the opposite of EVENT CAPTURING.
